# ShowKeys ![travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/mamewotoko/ShowKeys.svg?branch=feature/function_keys)

This is a simple OSX app to allow display of pressed keys.  It's basically just a semi-opaque window you can position anywhere and it will display the keys you press, as you press them.

It's not very complete, but it is functional.  Pull requests and issues are very welcome!

## Getting It To Work

ShowKeys needs accessibility permissions to listen to system-wide key events.  It will ask for these rights if it does not have them. Here's how it works.

### 1. Open ShowKeys, get prompt.

Click on "Open System Preferences"

### 2. Find ShowKeys in preferences, enable accessibility support.

### 3. Close ShowKeys and re-launch it.

That should make it work now!
